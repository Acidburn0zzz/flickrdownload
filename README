FlickrDownload

Introduction
------------

I have become a huge fan of Flickr over the last year and a half. I've really
enjoyed looking at other people's photos and uploading photos of my own. I
currently have about 3,500 photos on my account and I have spent a lot of time
organizing and labeling those photos.

I have been concerned about having all of my photos locked up in Flickr for
some time now. There are a lot of great people in the Flickr community but I
don't like having all of my photos locked up in a proprietary system. I don't
mind having my photos on there but I also like to have the exact same data
in an open format on my hard drive. I used to keep a separate copy of my
photos on my hard drive but that copy was not organized as nicely as the
photos on my Flickr account.

There have also been times when I wanted to make CDs of a few sets to give
out. Flickr does not have an interface that allows you to download all of your
photos at once. There are services that allow you to order DVDs of your photos
but I have not been happy with those DVDs. I also don't like the idea of having
to order DVDs to get a backup of my photos.

I've found a few programs that would backup your Flickr account but some
of them would truncate the title and not show the description. I wanted a
program that would download all of my sets and store the information about
each photo in a XML file. I could not find a program that would do that so I
wrote my own.

FlickrDownload is written in C#. It uses the FlickrNet API library
(http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=FlickrNet) to communicate
with Flickr. I developed it under Debian GNU/Linux and I use Mono to compile
and run the application. It should also run under Windows with no problems. I
have not tested this application under Windows though.

I also included some XSLT stylesheets that can be used to generate some HTML
files. 


How it works
------------

The program has a command line interface that does not have many bells and
whistles. You can specify your account name and the directory where the photos
should be stored. It will create subdirectories for each of your sets in the
destination directory. The program will check to see if the photos already
exist and if so, it will not download the photos again. This allows the
program to be ran in an incremental mode. I always run the program after I 
upload new photos to Flickr.

Here is an example of some of the files are directories that are created by
the application:

72157594267391686
72157603126591058
72157602581284555
sets.xml

The long numbers are the IDs of your sets. I did not use the title of the set as
the directory name so that the set names can be easily renamed on Flickr. This
allows the incremental backup feature to work correctly.

The sets.xml file contains some basic information about each set. Here is an
example:

<sets>
  <set>
    <title>Some of my favorite photos</title>
    <directory>72157594267391686</directory>
    <thumbnailFile>72157594267391686/208567793_thumb.jpg</thumbnailFile>
  </set>
  <set>
    <title>A Secret Cave</title>
    <directory>72157603126591058</directory>
    <thumbnailFile>72157603126591058/1971392366_thumb.jpg</thumbnailFile>
  </set>
  <set>
    <title>2007 Bridge Day Rappel</title>
    <directory>72157602581284555</directory>
    <thumbnailFile>72157602581284555/1672742729_thumb.jpg</thumbnailFile>
  </set>
</sets>

Now, change into one of the directories. You will see files like this:

1672724019_med.jpg
1672724019_orig.jpg
1672724019_thumb.jpg
1970501857_med.jpg
1970501857_orig.jpg
1970501857_thumb.jpg
photos.xml

The photo ID from Flickr is used as the filename so that the incremental backup
feature works correctly. The thumbnail, medium and original files are downloaded
from the server. A photos.xml file is created the has some information about
the photos. Here is an example:

<set>
  <title>Some of my favorite photos</title>
  <description/>
  <photo>
    <id>1672724019</id>
    <title>Mary and Brian on the catwalk</title>
    <description/>
    <dateTaken>10/20/2007 10:15:13</dateTaken>
    <privacy>
      <public/>
    </privacy>
    <originalFile>1672724019_orig.jpg</originalFile>
    <mediumFile>1672724019_med.jpg</mediumFile>
    <thumbnailFile>1672724019_thumb.jpg</thumbnailFile>
  </photo>
  <photo>
    <id>1970501857</id>
    <title>Formations</title>
    <description/>
    <dateTaken>11/10/2007 18:02:36</dateTaken>
    <privacy>
      <public/>
    </privacy>
    <originalFile>1970501857_orig.jpg</originalFile>
    <mediumFile>1970501857_med.jpg</mediumFile>
    <thumbnailFile>1970501857_thumb.jpg</thumbnailFile>
  </photo>
</set>

Since all of that information is stored in XML, a XSLT stylesheet is used
to generate HTML files that can be viewed inside a web browser. I included
some XSLT stylesheets with this program.


Instructions
------------

Note: This instructions were written for *NIX based systems.

Requirements:
  Mono - http://www.mono-project.com/
  FlickrNet - http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=FlickrNet
  MultiXmlTextWriter - already included. Homepage is at
      http://www.tkachenko.com/dotnet/multixmltextwriter.html

Change into the FlickrDownload directory and type nant. If the compilation is 
successful, it should create the binary bin/FlickrDownload.exe.

You are now ready to start downloading your photos. Pick a location where you
want to store your photos and run the following command:

mono /path/to/FlickrDownload.exe "Your User ID goes here" /destination/directory

You should see messages like "Downloading file XXX...". You can run this program
again at a future time and it will not download any photos that have already
been downloaded. The various photos.xml files and a single sets.xml file will
also be generated. Some HTML files will also be generated using some XSLT
stylesheets based on the information inside the XML files.

TODO
----

This program is fairly primitive but it solves the problem that I had. I am
releasing this because I am sure there are other people out there who want the
same thing.

My free time is fairly limited these days so I most likely won't have much time
to add additional features to this program. I am open to accepting patches.
Here are a few things that could be done to the program:

* Right now, the program will only check for the file's existence to see if
  it should be downloaded from the server. If the file exists, but is 
  corrupted on the server, then a newer version will not be downloaded from
  Flickr.
