Introduction
------------

FlickrDownload is a program that runs from the command that allows you to
download all of your photos and the associated metadata from Flickr. The
metadata is stored in a XML file and HTML files are generated so that you
have a fully-functioning static copy of your Flickr account on your local
computer. It supports the following features:

- Downloads information about all of your sets and collections.
- Supports downloading photos and videos.
- Downloads the following image sizes: small square, medium and full-sized
  images.
- A statistics page is generated with the following information: privacy stats
  (# of public and private photos), number of photos tagged, number of photos
  geotagged, disk space usage, photo licenses used, stats for each set (disk
  space and number of photos). The statistics are broken out separately for
  photos and videos.
- The statistics page will show you if you have any photos or videos that were
  uploaded multiple times.
- All data is stored in an open format for the long-term preservation of your
  data.

FlickrDownload is written in Java and uses the flickrj API library to
communicate with Flickr. 


Install from source instructions
--------------------------------

Note: Compiled versions of FlickrDownload are available at
http://www.onstation.org/flickrdownload/.

1) Go to https://github.com/masneyb/flickrdownload for instructions on how to
   check out the latest source code from git.

2) You will need to have Java installed on your computer. Type 'java -version'
   to see if it is installed. If not, Ubuntu GNU/Linux users can run
   'apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk openjdk-6-jre' to get a copy installed.

3) You will need to have ant installed to compile the source code. Ubuntu
   GNU/Linux users can run 'apt-get install ant'.

4) In the flickrdownload directory, type 'ant' and the compiled files will be
   placed in the build directory.


How to run
----------

1) In the build directory, you will see a FlickrDownload.jar file, along with
   several other files that end in jar. Type
   'java -jar FlickrDownload.jar' and you should see something like this:

Option "--photosDir" is required
usage: FlickrDownload  [--addExtensionToUnknownFiles VAL] [--authDir VAL] [--authUsername VAL] [--debug] [--downloadExifData] [--onlyData] [--limitToSet VAL ...] [--partial] --photosDir VAL [--photosUsername VAL]

I typically run it like this:

java -Xmx2048m -jar /home/masneyb/src/flickrdownload/build/FlickrDownload.jar --partial --photosDir /path/to/flickr/backup --addExtensionToUnknownFiles todelete --downloadExifData

You will have to specify the --authUsername option the first time that you run
the program to authenticate FlickrDownload with your flickr account. The
authentication token is stored in the same directory with your Flickr backup.

Once the backup is finished, open the sets.html file in your web browser.
